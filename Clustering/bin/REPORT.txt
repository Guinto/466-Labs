For the kmeans algorithm picked random initial cluster centroids. To recompute we found the average point of the cluster to find new centroids. We used zero point reassignment or zero centroid change for our stopping points. The SSE threshold we used was anything under 100 change. The program was implemented using Eucledean distance without dealing with outliers.

For the hclustering we used eucledean distance as the measure for the distance between two points. We use complete-link as the method for distance measures for clusters.
